# mouseweb

### Summary

A basic application to help users figure out how to choose a gaming mouse. Choosing a gaming mouse depends on the users hand size, grip style, and their preference of shape. 

**Note: This application isn't always going to be perfect, choosing a mouse is always going to be subjective and won't be 1 to 1. Use this app to give you an IDEA of what you would like.**
